# oldcurtains-automatization
This is a project to automate old curtains with arduino
first file is in rhinoceros the second one is in CAD. this are files to 3d print the gears that will attach to the lower part of the curtain chain. 

Then we add some motors to the gear. if you add a wifi conector to arduino you can control your curtains with voice comands like alexa, google, etc.
